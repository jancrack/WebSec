Скриптът 'TestSite' тества за sql injection със зададени опции в скрипта. Те могат да се променят. За да работи трябва да имаме изтеглени python и sqlmap (теглим като zip от github repo-то и разархивираме). Като в скрипта указваме откъде скриптът да си зареди sqlmap (file path). На по-късен етап можем да добавим
или сменим опции на sqlmap в скрипта 'TestSite'.Този сайт съм го сложил примерен като Тонито направи скрипта си ще насочим масива към този скрипт, който ще ги тества един по един. Какво точно тества Sqlmap в https://nvna.eu/wp/?group=126211&queryType=group&Week=15
От output-а виждаме, че sqlmap открива парамтрите и започва да ги тества дали са уязвими. 

Начин за използване:
